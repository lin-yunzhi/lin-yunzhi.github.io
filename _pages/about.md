Hello, I am Yunzhi Lin. I am a Bioengineering student at UC Berkeley who loves building useful things at the intersection of manufacturing, simulation, and human centered design. Thanks for stopping by!

I currently work at Silver Lake Research Corporation as an Engineering Assistant. I write and update SOPs for manufacturing equipment, build scheduling systems that align Manufacturing, Production, and QC, and run root cause analyses to improve yield and reduce cost. Earlier I served as an Engineering Intern, where I created validation protocols and reports, built a cost and capacity tool in Excel with VBA, designed a 3D production layout in Creo, and maintained critical machines to reduce downtime.

At Berkeley I am an Undergraduate Research Assistant in Mechanical Engineering with Professor Grace Gu, developing FEBio simulations of collagen alginate composites to evaluate properties while reducing experimental iterations. I previously worked in the Nanotechnology Lab with Dr. Waqas Khalid, refining microfluidic device fabrication and using COMSOL to model forces on carbon nanotube structures.

I lead EnableTech at Berkeley as President and Team Lead, where our team designed a grip assistive device that opens with minimal force yet keeps a secure hold at rest. I also serve on the Society of Women Engineers Science Outreach committee and help organize monthly hands on STEM events for students in grades 4 to 8.

I enjoy CAD and simulation tools such as SolidWorks, OnShape, 3DExperience, CREO, Fusion 360, FEA, FEBio, and COMSOL. I also code in Python, Java, SQL, JavaScript, C plus plus, and Scheme. I am a Bakar Ignite Scholar and earned second place in Mobile Robotics Technology at the 2023 SkillsUSA California Championship.
