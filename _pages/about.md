Hi, I’m Yunzhi, a Bioengineering student at UC Berkeley, passionate about mechanical design, mechanical design, medical devices, and biomaterials. Thank you for checking out my portfolio! 

I’m currently an Engineering Associate at Silver Lake Research, where I optimize manufacturing processes and enhance operational efficiency. In Professor Grace Gu’s MechE lab, I develop synthetic ligaments through bioprinting, mechanical testing, and FEBio simulations. As President of EnableTech@Berkeley, I lead student teams in engineering assistive technologies that empower people with disabilities.
