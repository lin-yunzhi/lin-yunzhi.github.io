Hello, I am Yunzhi Lin. I study Bioengineering at UC Berkeley and I enjoy building useful things with manufacturing, simulation, and human centered design. Thanks for stopping by!

I am an undergraduate researcher in Mechanical Engineering with Professor Grace Gu, using FEBio to model collagen alginate composites.

Previously, I worked at Silver Lake Research Corporation as an Engineering Assistant and Intern, supporting manufacturing, writing SOPs, and improving schedules and validation.

On campus, I lead EnableTech at Berkeley and volunteer with the Society of Women Engineers Science Outreach team.

Tools I enjoy: SolidWorks, Onshape, Creo, Fusion 360, FEBio, COMSOL. Languages: Python, Java, SQL, JavaScript, C++, Scheme.
